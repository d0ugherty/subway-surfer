# subway-surfer

A passenger information system built using the Django web framework.

This currently uses SEPTA's REST API and GTFS data. Eventually I would like to expand this to use another agency's data such as New Jersey Transit.

So far features include:

* Information boards for arrivals & departures

* Train information for the next train arriving on a given track

* Fare calculation


To Do:

* Real-time location tracking

* Trip planning
